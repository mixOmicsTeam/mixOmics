This repository contains the `R` package which is [hosted on Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mixOmics.html) and our development `GitHub` versions. Go to www.mixomics.org for information on how to use mixOmics. 

## Installation

(**macOS users only:** Ensure you have installed [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) first.)

### From Bioconductor (recommended)

The best way to install `mixOmics` is using `Bioconductor`. You can see the landing page for the release version of `mixOmics` on Bioconductor [here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mixOmics.html). Make sure you have the latest R version and the latest `BiocManager` package installed following [these instructions](https://www.bioconductor.org/install/).

```{r}
## install BiocManager if not installed
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

## install mixOmics
BiocManager::install('mixOmics')

## load mixOmics
library(mixOmics) 
```

### From Github

Bioconductor versions are updated twice a year, between these updates you can download the latest version of `mixOmics` from `Github`. Note that this latest version of mixOmics is under development and may not be stable, check the gitHub page for releases which have passed package testing.

```{r}
## install devtools
install.packages("devtools")

## install latest github version of mixOmics
devtools::install_github("mixOmicsTeam/mixOmics")
```

### From Docker container

You can install our latest stable Github version of `mixOmics` via our Docker container. You can do this by downloading and using the Docker desktop application or via the command line as described below. 

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  
**Note: this requires root privileges**


1) Install Docker following instructions at https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

**if your OS is not compatible with the latest version** download an older version of Docker from the following link:

* MacOS: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/release-notes/
* Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/release-notes/

Then open your system's command line interface (e.g. Terminal for MacOS and Command Promot for Windows) for the following steps.

**MacOS users only:** you will need to launch Docker Desktop to activate your root privileges before running any docker commands from the command line.
    
2) Pull mixOmics container

```bash
docker pull mixomicsteam/mixomics
```

3) Ensure it is installed

The following command lists the running images:
```bash
docker images
```

This lists the installed images. The output should be something similar to the following:
```
$ docker images 
  > REPOSITORY                       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
  > mixomicsteam/mixomics            latest    e755393ac247   2 weeks ago     4.38GB
```
4) Activate the container

Running the following command activates the container. You must change `your_password` to a custom password of your own. You can also customise ports (8787:8787) if desired/necessary. see https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/ for details.

```bash
docker run -e PASSWORD=your_password --rm -p 8787:8787 mixomicsteam/mixomics
```

5) Run

In your web browser, go to `http://localhost:8787/` (change port if necessary) and login with the following credentials:

*username*: rstudio  
*password*: (your_password set in step 4)

6) Inspect/stop

The following command lists the running containers:

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

The output should be something similar to the following:
```bash
$ sudo docker ps
  > CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                   COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES
  > f14b0bc28326   mixomicsteam/mixomics   "/init"   7 minutes ago   Up 7 minutes   0.0.0.0:8787->8787/tcp   compassionate_mestorf
```
The listed image ID can then be used to stop the container (here `f14b0bc28326`)
```bash
docker stop f14b0bc28326
```
