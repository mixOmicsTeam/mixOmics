\description{
Display relevance associations network for (regularized) canonical
correlation analysis and (sparse) PLS regression. The function avoids the
intensive computation of Pearson correlation matrices on large data set by
calculating instead a pair-wise similarity matrix directly obtained from the
latent components of our integrative approaches (CCA, PLS, block.pls
methods). The similarity value between a pair of variables is obtained by
calculating the sum of the correlations between the original variables and
each of the latent components of the model. The values in the similarity
matrix can be seen as a robust approximation of the Pearson correlation (see
Gonz√°lez et al. 2012 for a mathematical demonstration and exact formula).
The advantage of relevance networks is their ability to simultaneously
represent positive and negative correlations, which are missed by methods
based on Euclidean distances or mutual information. Those networks are
bipartite and thus only a link between two variables of different types can
be represented. The network can be saved in a .glm format using the
\code{igraph} package, the function \code{write.graph} and extracting the
output \code{object$gR}, see details.
}
\details{
\code{network} allows to infer large-scale association networks between the
\eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} datasets in \code{rcc} or \code{spls}. The output is a
graph where each \eqn{X}- and \eqn{Y}-variable corresponds to a node and the
edges included in the graph portray associations between them.

In \code{rcc}, to identify \eqn{X}-\eqn{Y} pairs showing relevant
associations, \code{network} calculate a similarity measure between \eqn{X}
and \eqn{Y} variables in a pair-wise manner: the scalar product value
between every pairs of vectors in dimension \code{length(comp)} representing
the variables \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} on the axis defined by \eqn{Z_i} with
\eqn{i} in \code{comp}, where \eqn{Z_i} is the equiangular vector between
the \eqn{i}-th \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} canonical variate.

In \code{spls}, if \code{object$mode} is \code{regression}, the similarity
measure between \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} variables is given by the scalar product
value between every pairs of vectors in dimension \code{length(comp)}
representing the variables \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} on the axis defined by
\eqn{U_i} with \eqn{i} in \code{comp}, where \eqn{U_i} is the \eqn{i}-th
\eqn{X} variate. If \code{object$mode} is \code{canonical} then \eqn{X} and
\eqn{Y} are represented on the axis defined by \eqn{U_i} and \eqn{V_i}
respectively.

Variable pairs with a high similarity measure (in absolute value) are
considered as relevant. By changing the cut-off, one can tune the relevance
of the associations to include or exclude relationships in the network.

\code{interactive=TRUE} open two device, one for association network, one
for scrollbar, and define an interactive process: by clicking either at each
end (\eqn{-} or \eqn{+}) of the scrollbar or at middle portion of this.
The position of the slider indicate which is the `cutoff' value associated
to the display network.

The network can be saved in a .glm format using the \pkg{igraph} package,
the function \code{write.graph} and extracting the output \code{obkect$gR}.

The interactive process is terminated by clicking the second button and
selecting \code{Stop} from the menu, or from the \code{Stop} menu on the graphics
window.

The \code{color.node} is a vector of length two, of any of the three kind of
\code{R} colors, i.e., either a color name (an element of \code{colors()}),
a hexadecimal string of the form \code{"#rrggbb"}, or an integer \code{i}
meaning \code{palette()[i]}. \code{color.node[1]} and \code{color.node[2]}
give the color for filled nodes of the \eqn{X}- and \eqn{Y}-variables
respectively. Defaults to \code{c("white", "white")}.

\code{color.edge} give the color to edges with colors corresponding to the
values in \code{mat}. Defaults to \code{color.GreenRed(100)} for negative
(green) and positive (red) correlations. We also propose other palettes of
colors, such as \code{color.jet} and \code{color.spectral}, see help on
those functions, and examples below. Other palette of colors from the stats
package can be used too.

\code{shape.node[1]} and \code{shape.node[2]} provide the shape of the nodes
associate to \eqn{X}- and \eqn{Y}-variables respectively. Current acceptable
values are \code{"circle"} and \code{"rectangle"}. Defaults to
\code{c("circle", "rectangle")}.

\code{lty.edge[1]} and \code{lty.egde[2]} give the line type to edges with
positive and negative weight respectively. Can be one of \code{"solid"},
\code{"dashed"}, \code{"dotted"}, \code{"dotdash"}, \code{"longdash"} and
\code{"twodash"}. Defaults to \code{c("solid", "solid")}.

\code{lwd.edge[1]} and \code{lwd.edge[2]} provide the line width to edges
with positive and negative weight respectively. This attribute is of type
double with a default of \code{c(1, 1)}.
