\usage{
mint.pca(
  X,
  ncomp = 2,
  study,
  scale = TRUE,
  tol = 1e-06,
  max.iter = 100,
  verbose.call = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{numeric matrix of predictors combining multiple independent studies
on the same set of predictors. \code{NA}s are allowed.}

\item{ncomp}{Number of components to include in the model (see Details).
Default to 2}

\item{study}{factor indicating the membership of each sample to each of the
studies being combined}

\item{scale}{Logical. If scale = TRUE, each block is standardized to zero
means and unit variances. Default = \code{TRUE}.}

\item{tol}{Convergence stopping value.}

\item{max.iter}{integer, the maximum number of iterations.}

\item{verbose.call}{Logical (Default=FALSE), if set to TRUE then the \code{$call}
component of the returned object will contain the variable values for all 
parameters. Note that this may cause large memory usage.}
}
\value{
\code{mint.pca} returns an object of class \code{"mint.pca", "pca"},
a list that contains the following components:

\item{X}{the centered and standardized original predictor matrix.}
\item{ncomp}{the number of components included in the model.}
\item{study}{The study grouping factor} \item{sdev}{the eigenvalues of the
covariance/correlation matrix, though the calculation is actually done with
the singular values of the data matrix or by using NIPALS.} \item{center,
scale}{the centering and scaling used, or \code{FALSE}.} \item{rotation}{the
matrix of variable loadings (i.e., a matrix whose columns contain the
eigenvectors).} \item{loadings}{same as 'rotation' to keep the mixOmics
spirit} \item{x}{the value of the rotated data (the centred (and scaled if
requested) data multiplied by the rotation/loadings matrix), also called the
principal components.} \item{variates}{same as 'x' to keep the mixOmics
spirit} \item{prop_expl_var}{Proportion of the explained variance from the multivariate
model after setting possible missing values to zero in the data.} \item{names}{list containing the names to be used
for individuals and variables.}
\item{call}{if \code{verbose.call = FALSE}, then just the function call is returned.
If \code{verbose.call = TRUE} then all the inputted values are accessable via
this component}

\description{
Function to integrate and combine multiple independent studies measured on
the same variables or predictors (P-integration) using a multigroup
Principal Component Analysis.
}
\details{
\code{mint.pca} fits a vertical PCA model with \code{ncomp} components in
which several independent studies measured on the same variables are
integrated.  The \code{study} factor indicates the membership of each sample
in each study. We advise to only combine studies with more than 3 samples as
the function performs internal scaling per study.

Missing values are handled by being disregarded during the cross product
computations in the algorithm without having to delete rows with missing
data. Alternatively, missing data can be imputed prior using the
\code{nipals} function.

Useful graphical outputs are available, e.g. \code{\link{plotIndiv}},
\code{\link{plotLoadings}}, \code{\link{plotVar}}.
