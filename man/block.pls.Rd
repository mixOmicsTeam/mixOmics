\arguments{
\item{X}{A named list of data sets (called 'blocks') measured on the same 
samples. Data in the list should be arranged in matrices, samples x variables, 
with samples order matching in all data sets.}

\item{Y}{Matrix response for a multivariate regression framework. Data
should be continuous variables (see \code{?block.plsda} for supervised
classification and factor response).}

\item{indY}{To supply if \code{Y} is missing, indicates the position of 
the matrix response in the list \code{X}.}

\item{ncomp}{the number of components to include in the model. Default to 2.
Applies to all blocks.}

\item{design}{numeric matrix of size (number of blocks in X) x (number of
blocks in X) with values between 0 and 1. Each value indicates the strenght
of the relationship to be modelled between two blocks; a value of 0
indicates no relationship, 1 is the maximum value. Alternatively, one of
c('null', 'full') indicating a disconnected or fully connected design,
respecively, or a numeric between 0 and 1 which will designate all
off-diagonal elements of a fully connected design (see examples in
\code{block.splsda}). If \code{Y} is provided instead of \code{indY}, the
\code{design} matrix is changed to include relationships to \code{Y}.}

\item{scheme}{Character, one of 'horst', 'factorial' or 'centroid'. Default =
\code{'horst'}, see reference.}

\item{mode}{Character string indicating the type of PLS algorithm to use. One
of \code{"regression"}, \code{"canonical"}, \code{"invariant"} or \code{"classic"}. See Details.}

\item{scale}{Logical. If scale = TRUE, each block is standardized to zero
means and unit variances (default: TRUE)}

\item{init}{Mode of initialization use in the algorithm, either by Singular
Value Decomposition of the product of each block of X with Y ('svd') or each
block independently ('svd.single'). Default = \code{svd.single}}

\item{tol}{Positive numeric used as convergence criteria/tolerance during the
iterative process. Default to \code{1e-06}.}

\item{max.iter}{Integer, the maximum number of iterations. Default to  100.}

\item{near.zero.var}{Logical, see the internal \code{\link{nearZeroVar}}
function (should be set to TRUE in particular for data with many zero
values). Setting this argument to FALSE (when appropriate) will speed up the
computations. Default value is FALSE.}

\item{all.outputs}{Logical. Computation can be faster when some specific
(and non-essential) outputs are not calculated. Default = \code{TRUE}.}

\item{verbose.call}{Logical (Default=FALSE), if set to TRUE then the \code{$call}
component of the returned object will contain the variable values for all 
parameters. Note that this may cause large memory usage.}
}
\value{
\code{block.pls} returns an object of class \code{'block.pls'}, a
list that contains the following components:

\item{X}{the centered and standardized original predictor matrix.}
\item{indY}{the position of the outcome Y in the output list X.}
\item{ncomp}{the number of components included in the model for each block.}
\item{mode}{the algorithm used to fit the model.} \item{variates}{list
containing the variates of each block of X.} \item{loadings}{list containing
the estimated loadings for the variates.} \item{names}{list containing the
names to be used for individuals and variables.} \item{nzv}{list containing
the zero- or near-zero predictors information.} \item{iter}{Number of
iterations of the algorithm for each component}
\item{prop_expl_var}{Percentage of explained variance for each
component and each block}
\item{call}{if \code{verbose.call = FALSE}, then just the function call is returned.
If \code{verbose.call = TRUE} then all the inputted values are accessable via
this component}

\description{
Integration of multiple data sets measured on the same samples or
observations, ie. N-integration. The method is partly based on Generalised
Canonical Correlation Analysis.
}
\details{
\code{block.spls} function fits a horizontal integration PLS model with a
specified number of components per block). An outcome needs to be provided,
either by \code{Y} or by its position \code{indY} in the list of blocks
\code{X}. Multi (continuous)response are supported. \code{X} and \code{Y}
can contain missing values. Missing values are handled by being disregarded
during the cross product computations in the algorithm \code{block.pls}
without having to delete rows with missing data. Alternatively, missing data
can be imputed prior using the \code{\link{impute.nipals}} function.

The type of algorithm to use is specified with the \code{mode} argument.
Four PLS algorithms are available: PLS regression \code{("regression")}, PLS
canonical analysis \code{("canonical")}, redundancy analysis
\code{("invariant")} and the classical PLS algorithm \code{("classic")} (see
References and \code{?pls} for more details).

Note that our method is partly based on Generalised Canonical Correlation
Analysis and differs from the MB-PLS approaches proposed by Kowalski et al.,
1989, J Chemom 3(1) and Westerhuis et al., 1998, J Chemom, 12(5).
